Network Issues: Network issues can occur due to various reasons such as server downtime, connection problems, or high network traffic. These issues can prevent Grafana from accessing the data source, resulting in a 403 error. Once the network issue is resolved (for example, if the server is back up, the connection problem is fixed, or the network traffic has decreased), Grafana can access the data source again, and the dashboard will work fine after a refresh.

Data Source Availability: If the data source (like a database or an API) is not ready or is busy when Grafana tries to access it, Grafana might not be able to retrieve the data, leading to a 403 error. However, once the data source becomes available or is no longer busy, Grafana can retrieve the data, and the dashboard will work fine after a refresh.

Session Timeout: A session in Grafana is a period of time that a user is logged in and interacting with the dashboard. If this session times out due to inactivity or some other reason, Grafana might not be able to access the data source, resulting in a 403 error. When you refresh the dashboard, a new session starts, and Grafana can access the data source again.

Auto-refresh Setting: The auto-refresh setting in Grafana determines how frequently the dashboard updates itself to display the most recent data. If this setting is configured to a long interval, the dashboard might display outdated data. By reducing this interval, you can ensure that your dashboard is always displaying the most recent data.

Remember, itâ€™s important to monitor your network and server logs for any anomalies that could lead to such issues. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the Grafana community or checking the Grafana documentation for more detailed troubleshooting steps. I hope this helps!
